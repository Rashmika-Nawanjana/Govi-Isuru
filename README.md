## **Government Officer Features**

- **Purpose:** Tools for government/agriculture officers to verify disease reports, schedule and manage field visits, audit actions, and monitor officer performance and escalations.
- **Key UI components:** `OfficerDashboard.js`, `ReportVerificationPanel.js`, `FieldVisitScheduling.js`, `InternalOfficerNotes.js`, `OfficerActionLogs.js`, `OfficerPerformanceDashboard.js`, `ReportVerificationPanel.js`, `AdminModerationPanel.js`.
- **Backend routes & endpoints (examples):**
  - Report verification: `GET /api/officer/reports`, `PUT /api/officer/reports/:id/status`, `PUT /api/officer/reports/:id/priority`, `POST /api/officer/reports/:id/note`, `GET /api/officer/report/:id/history`
  - Action logs / audit trail: `GET /api/officer/action-logs`
  - Officer stats & escalations: `GET /api/officer/stats`, `GET /api/officer/escalations`, `GET /api/officer/priority-config`
  - Officer workflow (field visits & notes): `POST /api/officer-workflow/field-visits`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/field-visits`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/field-visits/:id`, `PUT /api/officer-workflow/field-visits/:id/status`, `POST /api/officer-workflow/field-visits/:id/notes`, `POST /api/officer-workflow/field-visits/:id/photos`, `PUT /api/officer-workflow/field-visits/:id/findings`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/field-visit-stats`
  - Internal notes & flags: `POST /api/officer-workflow/internal-notes`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/internal-notes/target/:type/:id`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/internal-notes/farmer/:username`, `POST /api/officer-workflow/internal-notes/flag`, `DELETE /api/officer-workflow/internal-notes/:id/flag/:flag`, `PUT /api/officer-workflow/internal-notes/:id/resolve`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/internal-notes/stats`
  - Performance & leaderboard: `GET /api/officer-workflow/performance`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/performance/monthly`, `GET /api/officer-workflow/leaderboard`
- **Services & server-side components:** `officerService.js`, `officerPerformanceService.js`, `fieldVisitService.js`, `internalNoteService.js`, `alertService.js` — used to fetch reports, create field visits, record notes/flags, compute stats, and power escalations/leaderboards.
- **Models involved:** `DiseaseReport.js`, `OfficerActionLog.js`, `FieldVisit.js`, `InternalNote.js`, `User.js` — supporting audit trails, scheduling, and verification workflows.
- **Security & workflow:** Officer endpoints use an `officerAuthMiddleware` that requires `role: officer` or `role: admin` in the JWT; actions are recorded in `OfficerActionLog` for auditability.
- **Typical officer workflows:**
  - Review incoming AI or community disease reports → verify/reject/flag → optionally request `needs_field_visit` → schedule/complete field visit → record findings and internal notes → update report and trigger community alerts or escalations.
  - Monitor district-level dashboards for priority alerts, reporting coverage, and officer performance; use leaderboards and monthly comparisons to manage operations.

## 🚀 Docker Deploy

- Quick start builds and runs all services (frontend + backend + AI + MongoDB) locally or on an EC2 host.

### Prerequisites
- Docker and Docker Compose installed
- For EC2: open security group ports 80 (HTTP). 5000/8000 are optional for direct access.

### Environment
- Optional (overrides defaults): create a `.env` at repo root with:

```
JWT_SECRET=your_secret
MONGO_URI=mongodb+srv://<user>:<pass>@<cluster>/govi_isuru?retryWrites=true&w=majority
AI_SERVICE_URL=http://ai-service:8000
NEWS_API_KEY=
```

If `MONGO_URI` is not provided, a local MongoDB container is used at `mongodb://mongo:27017/govi_isuru`.

### Run

```bash
docker compose build
docker compose up -d
```

- Frontend: http://localhost/ (EC2: http://<ec2-public-ip>/)
- API (direct): http://localhost:5000/api
- AI Service (direct): http://localhost:8000/docs

Frontend is served by Nginx and proxies `/api/*` to the backend, so the app works behind a single public port 80.

### Stop

```bash
docker compose down
```

### Notes
- To use MongoDB Atlas on EC2, ensure the EC2 public IP is whitelisted in Atlas or use VPC peering.
- For production, keep only port 80 open in the security group; 5000/8000 can remain closed.
| NumPy | Latest | Numerical Computing |

### DevOps & Deployment
| Technology | Purpose |
|------------|---------|
| Docker | Containerization |
| Docker Compose | Multi-container orchestration |
| Nginx | Reverse proxy |

### Grad-CAM Explainability
The model includes **Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping** (Grad-CAM) to visualize which regions of the leaf image the model focused on to make its prediction. This provides:
- **Transparency**: Farmers can see the evidence behind diagnoses
- **Trust**: Visual proof that the AI is looking at the right areas
- **Education**: Helps farmers learn to identify symptoms themselves

### Yield Prediction Model

#### Data Source
- **Historical Data**: 10 years of Sri Lankan paddy statistics (2015-2024)
- **Coverage**: All 25 districts across 3 climate zones
- **Seasons**: Maha (October-March) and Yala (April-September)
- **Records**: 475+ data points with yield, production, and area metrics

#### Climate Zones
| Zone | Districts | Characteristics |
|------|-----------|-----------------|
| Wet Zone | Colombo, Gampaha, Kalutara, Galle, Matara, Ratnapura, Kegalle, Kandy, NuwaraEliya | High rainfall (>2500mm), no irrigation needed |
| Dry Zone | Anuradhapura, Polonnaruwa, Ampara, Batticaloa, Trincomalee, Jaffna, Kilinochchi, Mullaitivu, Mannar, Vavuniya, Hambantota | Low rainfall, irrigation dependent |
| Intermediate | Kurunegala, Puttalam, Matale, Badulla, Monaragala | Moderate conditions |

#### Prediction Methods
1. **ML Model**: Pre-trained model loaded from `yield_predictor.pkl`
   - Uses historical patterns and district-specific features
   - Applies trend adjustment and year-based variation
2. **Statistical Fallback**: When ML model unavailable
   - Base yield from district historical average
   - Trend slope adjustment per year
   - Season adjustment (Yala typically 8% lower)

#### Key Metrics
| Metric | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `yield_kg_ha` | Predicted yield in kg per hectare |
| `stability_index` | Consistency score (0-1, higher = more stable) |
| `trend_slope` | Year-over-year change rate |
| `confidence` | Prediction reliability (high/medium/low) |
